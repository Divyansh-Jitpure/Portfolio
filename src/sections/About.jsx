          Hey there! 👋 I'm Divyansh Jitpure, a web developer who loves working
          with front-end stuff like React, JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. I’m
          passionate about bringing creativity and functionality to every
          project I work on.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-4">
          💻 I enjoy creating seamless and visually appealing user experiences.
          With my skills in React JS and Tailwind CSS, I aim to build
          interactive web apps that keep users engaged and to turn design ideas
          into elegant, responsive, and user-friendly interfaces.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-4">
          When I'm not coding, you can find me exploring new Tech trends,
          playing The Piano 🎹 or playing video games 🎮.
        </p>
